# hello-world

this is a God dream. this is everything.

Hello everyone! I love God so much! He has always been there for me, every single time. Jesus is my Savior. He is my Rock and my Salvation. I love Jesus so much. I was homeless at one point in life and had to sleep in my car but God made a way for me to get an apartment and get my life back on track. Jesus was with me the whole time. He brought me peace beyond my understanding. It used to be soo cold in that car at nights, but Jesus was there. I'm so thankful!
